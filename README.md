# Wifi-jammer-prevention-sim
Simulation of a wifi jammer with python and its prevention technology several types of jamming methods such as noise ,tone, pulse and sweep jamming, Prevention technique uses channel hopping, adaptive filter and spread spectrum
jammer.py conisist of just a jammer simulation 
jamch.py consist of a jammer simulation plus a channel hopping prevention technique 
jammer+prevention.py concist of severeal jamming techniques plus various prevention techniques 
in order the the prevention techniques to, SNR and success rate to go up press apply prevention again 2 - 3 times reducing any time of noise in the frequency domain
